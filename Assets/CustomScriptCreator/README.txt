Package Creator: Nicolas Pegolo dos Anjos


Package created to make c# class creations more fast and easy, the framework creates a tab in the editor for 
creating different types of c# scripts and already adding namespaces to them automatically.


The options for creating the custom is scripts are:  Assets/Create/CustomScripts

You can change the editor Create tab priority in CustomCreatorTab on the [MenuItem("path", priority = value)] in lines 30, 59 and 88. 


The files in the framework are: 

CustomCreatorTab: The framework's main class, responsible for generating the editor's visual tabs and creating the 
files in the right folders.

CSharpFileContents: Class responsible for generating syntax for c# files

FrameworkHelp: Class responsible for generating the help tabs in the editor


If you have any doubts, you can read the "Custom Script Creator Guide.pdf" in the archives.
